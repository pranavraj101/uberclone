# Clerk For Authentication, Neon for Database and Google API for direction and location search



**Project Title**: UberClone â€“ Ride-hailing Application

**Overview**:  
UberClone is a ride-hailing platform designed to mimic the core functionality of popular ride-sharing services. The application allows users to book rides, view nearby drivers, track their location in real-time, and get fare estimates. The backend and frontend of the app are integrated with cutting-edge technologies, including Google API for location services, Clerk for user authentication, and Neon for the database.

**Features**:
1. **User Authentication (Clerk)**:
   - Secure user registration and login process.
   - OAuth integration for seamless authentication (Google, Facebook, etc.).
   - Role-based access control for drivers and riders.

2. **Location Services (Google API)**:
   - Real-time location tracking for both drivers and riders.
   - Google Maps integration for selecting pickup/drop-off points.
   - Estimated ride time and distance calculation using Google Distance Matrix API.
   - Display of nearby available drivers for quick pickup.

3. **Database (Neon)**:
   - Highly scalable and low-latency database for storing user, driver, and ride information.
   - Efficient queries for ride history, user profiles, and driver schedules.
   - Support for real-time ride status updates and transactional data consistency.

**Tech Stack**:
- **Frontend**: React Native (for cross-platform mobile app development).
- **Backend**: Node.js (RESTful API server).
- **Database**: Neon (PostgreSQL-based cloud database).
- **Authentication**: Clerk (modern user authentication solution).
- **APIs**: Google Maps API for location services and distance calculations.
